# Rigshospitalet Beacon V2 UI

## Introduction

One of the bottlenecks in human biomedical research is finding datasets that researchers can analyse using new approaches. Developed by the GA4GH Discovery Work Stream, the Beacon API is a simple data discovery tool that allows someone to search genomic and biomedical data worldwide, helping researchers find new datasets without compromising dataset privacy or ownership.

Here, we extend the [beacon training-ui](https://github.com/EGA-archive/beacon-2.x-training-ui) developed by the [European Genome Archive](www.ega-archive.org)) into beacon v2 specification and populate with synthetic data from the [CINECA project](https://www.cineca-project.eu/cineca-synthetic-datasets)
